Overview
In the heat of a Formula E race, teams need fast access to insights that can help drivers make split-second decisions and cross the finish line first. Can your data-science skills help Envision Racing, one of the founding teams in the championship, take home even more trophies?

To do so, you will have to build a machine learning model that predicts the Envision Racing drivers’ lap times for the all-important qualifying sessions that determine what position they start the race in. Winning races involves a combination of both a driver’s skills and data analytics. To help the team you’ll need to consider several factors that affect performance during a session, including weather, track conditions, and a driver’s familiarity with the track.

Genpact, a leading professional services firm that focuses on digital transformation, is collaborating with Envision Racing, a Formula E racing team and digital hackathon platform MachineHack, a brainchild of Analytics India Magazine, is launching ‘Dare in Reality’.’ This two-week hackathon allows data science professionals, machine learning engineers, artificial intelligence practitioners, and other tech enthusiasts to showcase their skills, impress the judges, and stand a chance to win exciting cash prizes.

Genpact (NYSE: G) is a global professional services firm that makes business transformation real, driving digital-led innovation and digitally enabled intelligent operations for our clients.
